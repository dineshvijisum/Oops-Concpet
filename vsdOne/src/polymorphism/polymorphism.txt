What is Polymorphism? -- many porms
is the capability of a method (function) to do different things based on the 
object that it is acting upon.

Types:
1.Static/Compile/Early binding (overloading)
2.Dynamic/RunTime/Late binding (Overriding)

OverLoading: Method name should be same
1.If there is any change (change in data type, or change in order of passing)
in the parameter passed to a method, then its overloading.
2.Happens at compile-time
3.Done in the same class

Overriding : Method name should be same
1.No change in anything
2.Happens at runtime
3.Done in the parent /child relationship


Aspects                            Overloading                                      Overriding
Name of the method                  must be same                                    Must be same
Argument types(Parameter Pass)      must be diff.(or change in passing order)       must be diff.(or change in passing order) 
Return types                       Can be anything                                  must be same or Covarient return types
Access modifiers                   Can be anything                                  It should be equal modifier or greater modifier
Throwing Exception                 No restrictions,can be anything                  Parent should throw the same or greater exception
Private methods                    Can be overloaded                                Cannot be override
