Abstraction:
Hiding the implementation details.

How can we achieve abstraction?
1.Abstract Class (0 to 100% abstraction)
2.Interface (100% Abstraction) - completely we don't know what we do then we can choose interface

Abstract Class:
1.If a class is having an unimplemented method then the method should be declared abstract.
2.If a class is having one abstract method then it should be declared abstract
3.It may or may not have implementation methods
4.A class can be declared abstract even if doesn't have abstract methods
5.Can we create object for abstract class? 
  can't able to create
6.If a child does not implement all the abstract methods of a parent class, then the child
  class must need to be declared abstract as well
  
Interface:
What is interface?
Like class but it is not class

Why?
An interface have methods and variables just like the class.
But the variables are public, static, final by default.
the methods declared in interface are abstract by default.
methods are public and abstract by default.

Why interface is needed?
To achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance.
 
 How a class can use another interface?
 By using Implements keyword.
 
 How a Interface can use another interface?
 By using Extends keyword.
 
 Tag or marker interface:
 An empty interface is known as tag or marker interface.
 Ex: Serializable, cloneable
